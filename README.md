### There will be several audio plugins on this repository.

The projects use FRUT to turn the .jucer files into CMakelists files.
Hopefully it will be useful later to add some CI more easily.

When I create music, I like good sounding, simple and straight forward audio plugins. Therefore that's 
what I'd like to achieve with the plugins I create.

Not sure yet but I want to do something with filters and rhythm.
For now the plugin simply applies a succession of cutoff frequencies
in sync with the bpm.

# Other project
A delay followed by a filter but with the cutoff frequency
is controlled by the ouput magnitude of the delay.
Thanks to Th√©o for the idea.
